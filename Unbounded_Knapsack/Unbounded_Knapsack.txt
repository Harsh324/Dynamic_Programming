## Unbounded Knapsack

    ** As we know in the case of 0-1:Knapsack there was a weight array and a value array of items given
       for any item we are given a choice to whether include it or not in the Knapsack.
       So after decision of choice an item is processed and this item is never added in knapsack.

    ** But in Unbounded knapsack any item can be taken into consideration again even after choice decison,
       is taken. Basically supply for any item is unlimited.

    ** Allows multiple occurences of same item.

    ** Variations based on Knapsack are 
        1. Rod Cutting
        2. Coin Change 1
        3. Coin Change 2
        4. Maximum Ribbon cut
