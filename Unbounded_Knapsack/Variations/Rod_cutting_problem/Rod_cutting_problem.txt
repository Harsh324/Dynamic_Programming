## Rod cutting problem 

    ** Length[] : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ,6, 7 ,8}
       Prize[] : {1, 5, 8,9, 10, 17, 17, 20}
       N = 8

    ** Given a rod of Length N we can cut the rod infinite number of times,
       we need to maximize the Profit Obatined by Cutting the Rod.

    ** some times only prize array is given then we can generate length array Ranging {1, N}

    ** This Resembles Knapsack But here any number of pieces can be taken,
       Hence it resembles Unbounded Knapsack.
