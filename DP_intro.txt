## Dynamic Programming

    ** Enhanced Recursion can be said as Dynamic programming

    ** How to identify the problem as DP problem

        1. All methods to identify Recursion is used to identify DP.

            ** Call for the function more than one time may be required.

        2. Optimality

            ** Requirement for maximize , minimize, Largest, smallest can be asked.

    ** Steps to Make Recursive function

        1. Write Recursive code , Memoize it and write Top down approach.
