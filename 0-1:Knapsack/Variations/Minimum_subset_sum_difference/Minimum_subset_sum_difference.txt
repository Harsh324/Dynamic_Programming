## Minimum Subset sum difference 

    ** The Problem statement says that given an array we need to Get two subsets such that,
       absolute Difference of their Sum is Minimum.

    ** We need to return the Minimus Absolute Difference.

    ** Similarity with the Equal sum subset Problem could be that in that problem Minimum Difference is Zero.

    ** Let the Two Such such subset has Sums as S1 and S2.We will try to find the Range,
       of Possible values for S1 and S2.

    ** Since Subset could be either Null or Equal to Array, hence Possible Ranges for the,
       S1 and S2 will be 0 and Sum of the Array.
       

    ** So S1 and S2 will lie in The Range {0,sum(Arr)}

    ** We will Figure out All Possible Sum that could be possible with any subset in the given range. 
       Thus there will be a set of all posiible sums.

    ** In this set half value  are the absolute value of (Nax Sum - other).

    ** This Problem is Extended part of the Subset Sum Problem.
