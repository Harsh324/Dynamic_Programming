## Subset sum problem

    ** This problem states that a set is given along with a sum. 
       we need to check wether any subset with the given sum is present in th set or not.

    ** Similarity of This problem with 0-1:Knapsack is ther is a maximum sum and also choice,
       to choose the element of the set.

    ** We will write the base case for the problem 

        if Size of set is Zero return False;

        if Sum is Zero return True

    ** Again we will take matrix DP[N + 1][Sum + 1] where N is Size of set and Sum is the given Sum.

        DP[N][W] will return True or False.
