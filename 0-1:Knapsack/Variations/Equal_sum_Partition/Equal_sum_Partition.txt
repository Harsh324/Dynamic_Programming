## Equal Sum partition

    ** The Problem states that given an array we need to divide the array in two subsets,
       such that both subset has same sum.

    ** If possible to do so the return True else return False;

    ** This problem is extended version of Subset Sum problem

    ** if Sum is Odd then it is Not possible to get such two subsets.

    ** if Sum is even then We need to find a Subset with Sum / 2;
